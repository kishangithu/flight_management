Project Overview
The Flight Status project is designed to provide real-time updates on flight statuses and manage notifications. The project includes a frontend web application, a backend API, a notification system, and database management. The system enables users to view flight information, receive notifications, and administrators to manage flight data and notification settings.

Frontend Documentation
Technologies Used
HTML: Markup language for structuring the frontend.
CSS: Styling language for visual presentation.
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
Redux: State management library.

Components
App.js
Purpose: The root component of the React application. Sets up routing and integrates Redux store.
Key Features: Includes BrowserRouter for routing, Provider for Redux integration.

FlightDetails.js
Purpose: Displays detailed information about a specific flight.
Key Features: Fetches flight details using getFlightById from api.js, displays flight status, and allows status updates.

api.js
Purpose: Manages API requests to the backend.
Key Features: Provides functions for fetching all flights, retrieving flight details, updating flight statuses, and managing notifications.

API Integration
Fetching Flights: Uses getAllFlights() to retrieve a list of flights.
Fetching Flight Details: Uses getFlightById(flightId) to get details of a specific flight.
Updating Flight Status: Uses updateFlightStatus(flightId, statusUpdate) to update the status of a flight.

Notification Settings: 
Uses saveNotificationSettings(settings) and getNotificationSettings() for managing user preferences.
State Management
Redux: Manages application state, including flight data and user settings.
Reducers and Actions: Define how the state updates in response to actions.

Styling
CSS Modules: Scoped styling for components.
Variables: Defined in variables.css to ensure consistent design across the application.
